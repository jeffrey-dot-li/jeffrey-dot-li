And maybe everything ain't all that it seem <br>
But it seem so impossible feel more like a dream <br>
And it is what it is till it ain't. <br>
Dream so high and so far till got wings on your arms <br>
Fly up high touch the sky till you faint. <br>

Can you tell me what you see on the backs of your eyes <br>
When you close them together and hold 'em shut tight <br>
Do you see colors and shapes that you don't recognize <br>
Even though it feel like they were with you last night <br>

And what does the voice tell you in the back of your mind <br>
Do you feel it from behind <br>
Do you hear it speak in time and rhythm <br>
Like the answers were given <br>
At the back of the book that you had all along,<br>
But never dared to look because that shit was too long <br>
And too hard. <br>

So if these gifts were given, <br>
Not by merit but grace alone, <br>
Why do we still cling so tightly, <br> 
And try to pretend their our own <br>
When I think we all know that it ain't.

That there's gonna come a time when our is time is gonna come <br>
When God dials our phone and He calls us up <br>
Like we standing on deck waiting for next batter up <br>
So aren't we better off, leaving it all on the field <br>
And when my time is up, have I done enough? <br>

Given back enough? Driven fast enough?<br>
Will I look at what I've had and think I've had enough? <br>
Or will I look for what I've had to find it was nothing at all?<br>
Man that’s the shit I fear like the fall. <br>

That when it comes down too it <br>
It all turns to dust with the snap of a finger <br>
And all you see is gray even when the color still lingers <br>
Like the scene in that movie when it all fades away <br>
And the credits start to play <br>
And your just left there wondering if there was another way <br>
And why it always seems like reality is so often…  <br>
Disappointing. <br>

But you know what they say, it is what it is till it isn't <br>
And I ain't bout to be waiting here trying to find what I'm missing <br>
Cause I been given to many gifts to miss the life that I'm living <br>
Feel the present, I'm insistin <br>
I talk too much, gotta listen. <br>
And stop tryna worry if they ask <br>
"What was all of it for?" <br>
Yeah, well, I guess it really ain't 2009 no more. <br>

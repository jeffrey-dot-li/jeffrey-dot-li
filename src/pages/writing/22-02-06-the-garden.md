What went through man's head <br>
As he left with no return <br>
Did he know then in his heart <br>
He could never earn back what he was leaving <br>
No turning back to the Gates of Eden <br>
And the only company you have  <br>
On this lonely path you're leading <br>
Is the compass and the map <br>
Of the ground beneath your feet <br>
Yet can never shake the feeling <br>
That the ground on which you tread <br>
Will be always and forever foreign land <br>
Can never answer the question <br>
What God even has for you in plan. <br>
Whether there ever was a lesson <br>
You had missed in all this mess <br>
For if this all was truly destined <br>
And this life is just a test <br>
Why then do I still remember <br>
These dreams I can't forget <br>
See the same scenes before me<br>
As I did the day I left

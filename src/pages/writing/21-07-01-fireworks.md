When we first put fireworks in the sky, how did it feel when the power of thunder and lighting first fell into our hands? Maybe for no more than a second, but all the same, in that one second, the night lights up with these stars of our own making, and the sky trembles under the power of human creation. Is it such a mystery, then, that we spent centuries shooting gunpowder cannons into the sky before we turned them against one another? When life and death is as fleeting as a flash of lighting, here in one moment and gone the next - what is the power over lives of mere mortal men against the power to make the sky dance and the winds roar with our stars that we shoot to the sky?

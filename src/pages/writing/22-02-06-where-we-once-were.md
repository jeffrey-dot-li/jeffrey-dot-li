What went through man's head <br>
As he left with no return <br>
Did he know then in his heart <br>
He could never earn back what he was leaving <br>
No turning back to the Gates of Eden <br>
And the only company you have  <br>
On this lonely path you're leading <br>
Is the compass and the map <br>
Of the ground beneath your feet <br>
Yet can never shake the feeling <br>
That the ground on which you tread <br>
Will be always and forever foreign land <br>
Can never answer the question <br>
What God even has for you in plan. <br>
Whether there ever was a lesson <br>
You had missed in all this mess <br>
Amidst the chaos and the stress <br>
Had I failed to see the Lord testing me? <br>

'Cause all them times I've prayed and tried <br>
The emptyness still stayed inside of me <br>
Unmoving, the only thing that never leaves <br>
Like from those autumn trees, falling falling <br>
Give way to winter winds I hear it calling out for me <br>

And in the deafening storm, I heard my name <br>
In the darkest nights, the vision came <br>

Of home and hearth upon this earth <br>
See the warmth and light glowing faintly there on the horizon <br>

But still I wonder, that light <br>
Why was this vision sent to me if it wasn't meant to be <br>
Because even as I gently gently row my boat down Noah's stream <br>

But the destination always feels so far off in the distance <br>

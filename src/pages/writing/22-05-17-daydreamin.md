Always end up back here it seems <br>
i can't keep the scenes away <br>
when I'm daydreamin <br>
It's my whole being that longs to be <br>
back yonder <br>
across the water <br>
don't it ever make you wonder  <br>
what we used to daydream about as kids <br>
say was it ever just a moment like this <br>
were these the days we was livin for <br>
well shit, i really hope i don't miss <br>
but i never miss just hits is where we going <br>
only thing that i been knowing <br>
is it seem like we just never stop growing <br>
from '03 till infinity  <br>
just keep it rolling no stop <br>
pop the locks off the bike and we ride away <br>
into the horizon hoping its a brighter day <br>
that we call tomorrow <br>
but shit i just been daydreamin <br>
